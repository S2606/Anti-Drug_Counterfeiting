# Anti-Drug Counterfeiting
Problem statement:-
* A visibly huge problem(especially in developing nations) with market worth 10 bn dollars in india alone.
* No way of estimating domestic vs export split and slow progress in identifying the perpetrators.

### Okay, How does counterfeiting happen? ###
- A factory manufacturing counterfeit drugs under a different name
- Through contract manufacturing
- Reintroducing expired drug into the market

### Since the problem is now clear to us, how about the solution? ##
Introducing item-level identifiers(sounds vague doesn't it?)


So what can be done is:
- Having a unique serial number for the item at SKU(stock keeping unit) level
- The SKU shall be added as a block on the blockchain which can help in authenticity & trace verification.
- This also helps in ensuring transparency across the supply-chain
